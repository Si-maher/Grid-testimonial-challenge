# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I decided to approach this design Mobile-first, which after reading some blogs and articles seems to be a contested approach and when that is hotly debated. I also used Grid area's which seemed to make the project a little easier, although I am sure that there is still an easier way? 

But, the project works, and it was good to use both Flex and Grid together. At the beginning I wrote a few classes using the BEM method which I ended up deleting and focused more on Utility classes, as so many of the same properties were applied across the project.

### Continued development

I shall take what I have learned from this project and apply it the next Frontend project, focusing on layout's and best practise .
